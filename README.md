A simple platformer. I made a simple physics engine and put effort into animating sprites.

The game itself is 3 levels with new mechanics introduced with each level: 
1) locked doors
2) buttons and disappearing blocks
3) ability to use character that died in previous attempt to pass level as a way to traverse spikes
